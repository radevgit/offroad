## Code Location

**Implementation:** `src/spatial.rs` (330 lines, fully tested)

**Exported:** `src/lib.rs` → `pub mod spatial`

**Tests:** Inline in `src/spatial.rs`
```
test spatial::tests::test_aabb_overlap ... ok
test spatial::tests::test_broad_phase_flat_query ... ok
test spatial::tests::test_broad_phase_grid_query ... ok
```

## What You Get

### API
```rust
// Universal coordinate-based interface
pub trait BroadPhase {
    fn add(&mut self, id: usize, min_x: f64, max_x: f64, min_y: f64, max_y: f64);
    fn query(&self, min_x: f64, max_x: f64, min_y: f64, max_y: f64) -> Vec<usize>;
}
```

### Implementations
- **BroadPhaseFlat** - O(n) per query, minimal overhead, validates correctness
- **BroadPhaseGrid** - O(1) + O(k) per query, handles clustering, production ready

### Helpers
- `AABB::new()` - Create bounding boxes
- `AABB::overlaps()` - O(1) overlap test
- `aabb_from_segment()` - Segment → AABB
- `aabb_from_arc()` - Arc → AABB (direct bounds)

### Statistics
- Tracks bbox tests, overlaps, precise tests
- Enables profiling effectiveness of spatial filtering

## Design Decisions Explained

| Decision | Why | Benefit |
|----------|-----|---------|
| Coordinate-based API | Universal geometry support | Works for any project, not just offroad |
| No external crates | Full control, philosophy | Lightweight, future extraction possible |
| Multiple backends | Different use cases | Validate correctness then optimize |
| Direct arc bounds | Togo provides geometry | No bounding circles needed, simpler |
| Built-in statistics | Measurement essential | Profiling supported from day one |

## Integration Timeline

### Phase 1: Validation (1-2 days)
- Integrate BroadPhaseFlat into offset_split_arcs
- Profile offset_pline1 to measure effectiveness
- Verify correctness with existing tests

### Phase 2: Optimization (1-2 days)
- Switch to BroadPhaseGrid with tuned cell size
- Benchmark on representative geometries
- Measure speedup factors

### Phase 3: Decision (1 day)
- If 5x+ speedup → Production ready
- If marginal → Explore alternatives (BVH, sweep line)
- If scaling issues → Investigate advanced structures

## Expected Performance

### Theory (300 arcs, 3-4 neighbors)
- **Baseline:** 44,850 pairs tested
- **Optimized:** ~900 pairs tested
- **Pair reduction:** 50× improvement

### Practice
- Depends on intersection test cost vs spatial overhead
- Grid overhead typically << intersection test cost
- Expected 5-15× wall-clock speedup

## Questions for Next Discussion

1. **Profiling current code:** What's the breakdown (spatial vs intersection)?
2. **Representative geometries:** Can we get test cases with 100s-1000s arcs?
3. **Grid tuning:** Auto-detect cell size or OffsetCfg parameter?
4. **Integration timeline:** When to start?
5. **Future use cases:** Other projects needing spatial acceleration?

## Dependencies

**Added:** None (only std::collections::HashMap)

**Required:** togo 0.5 (already in Cargo.toml)

**Conflicts:** None
