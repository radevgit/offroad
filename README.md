## 2D offsetting for arc polylines/polygons



![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radevgit/offroad/refs/heads/main/img/offsets.svg "arc-line polygon offsets")


## Status

Currently, the library is in active development and may not yet be feature-complete.

It is already useful to produce "soup of arcs" when polyline is provided.
The arcs are not ordered however.

## Examples

Check the examples directory for usage.
